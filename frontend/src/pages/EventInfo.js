            <p>
                Live Nation Singapore is thrilled to announce that South Korean multifaceted talent, LEE YOUNGJI, will be 
                coming to Singapore to perform for the first time ever as part of her first Asia tour!

                LEE YOUNGJI burst onto the scene in 2019 with her debut single "Dark Room", immediately garnering attention for 
                her refreshingly candid approach to music. Since then, she has achieved a meteoric rise, gaining a strong and 
                dedicated following for her unique musical style, engaging lyrics, and charismatic presence. She is recognized 
                for her contributions to the South Korean hip-hop and rap scene, as she was the youngest and first female winner 
                of "High School Rapper 3” and was the first female contestant to win the popular South Korean rap competition TV show, 
                "Show Me the Money 11".

                LEE YOUNGJI's music is a fusion of dynamic beats, poignant storytelling, and a distinct vocal delivery that sets her 
                apart from the crowd. She fearlessly tackles a wide range of subjects in her lyrics, from personal experiences and 
                social commentary to introspective musings on life, love, and identity. Her ability to effortlessly switch between 
                hard-hitting verses and melodic hooks showcases her versatility as an artiste.

                LEE YOUNGJI's impact and popularity extends beyond her music. Widely known for her quirky and funny personality, 
                she’s a rising variety show queen in the South Korean entertainment scene, with notable features as the host of the 
                popular YouTube talk show, "No Prepare", and one of the cast members in "Earth Arcade".

                LEE YOUNGJI 1st ASIA TOUR ‘THE MAIN CHARACTER’ – SINGAPORE will take place at Capitol Theatre on 20 October 2023 
                (Friday). Live Nation members can secure tickets first during the exclusive Live Nation presale on 24 Aug (Thu) from 12pm
